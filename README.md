# Project 1
<ul>
  <li>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</li>
    <ul>
      This project required you to use OOP to create 2 clocks that display simultaneously and allowed the user to input using secure and effecient c++ code.
    </ul>
  <li>What did you do particularly well?</li>
    <ul>
      I believe I managed to display the clock in a manner that adequately displays the appropiate time. 
    </ul>
  <li>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</li>
    <ul>
      Honestly you could just include some time headers that do the job very well and securely but doing so wouldnt allow the teacher to see whether the student was able to show a proper use of OOP.
    </ul>
  <li>Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?</li>
    <ul>
      Had a problem orgionally on how to clear the console but quick search online allowed me to find the answer. After taking this course I have joined multiple coding discords that allowed for fast responses with problems aswell as a safe space with like minded individuals. 
    </ul>
  <li>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?</li>
    <ul>
      The basics of OOP will always be used and necesary. 
    </ul>
  <li>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</li>
    <ul>
      Honestly I could have spent longer on making it more readable by adding more comments.
    </ul>
